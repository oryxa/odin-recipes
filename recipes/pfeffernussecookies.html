    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Molasses and honey:These super sweet pfeffernusse cookies start with a blend of molasses and honey.</li>
        <li>Shortening and margarine: This recipe calls for shortening and margarine instead of butter, as butter tends to spread (we want these cookies to rise as high as possible).</li>
        <li>Eggs: Two large eggs lend moisture and help bind the cookie dough together.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the cookies structure.</li>
        <li>Sugars: You'll need a blend of white and brown sugars for this cozy pfeffernusse cookie recipe.</li>
        <li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookie dough rise.</li>
